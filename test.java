//Strategy Pattern
   // When you want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list
   // when you need to use one of several behaviors dinamically
   // Reduce long list of conditionals
   // Avoid duplicate code
   // Keeps class changes from forcing other class changes
   // Can hide complicated / secret code from the user
   // Negative: Increased number of Objects / Classes
